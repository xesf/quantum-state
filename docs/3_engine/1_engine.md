1. TOC
{:toc}

The idea of this section is to provide a high-level overview of the engine's structure, game mechanics, game data formats and all technical details that are not directly related to the game logic, but rather to the engine's architecture and design principles. The game logic itself is documented in the [Game](../4_game/1_game.md) section.
