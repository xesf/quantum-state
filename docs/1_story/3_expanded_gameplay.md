# Gameplay Concepts
## 3rd Person Action-Adventure Implementation

### Core Gameplay Systems

As a 3rd person action-adventure, "Quantum State" will feature:

- **Dynamic Camera System**: Shifts between wider angles during exploration and tighter framing during intense moments
- **Contextual Movement**: Fluid parkour and environmental interaction
- **Perception Mechanics**: Visual filters and effects that represent Alex's shifting perception
- **Reality Meter**: UI element showing Alex's current grip on reality
- **Inventory System**: Combines real tools with perceived items that only work during delusions
- **Dialog System**: NPCs respond differently based on Alex's current mental state

### Episode 1: "Digital Surveillance"

#### Expanded Gameplay Elements
1. **Stealth Mechanics**:
   - **Perception Cones**: Visible representations of where Alex believes cameras and agents can see
   - **Shadow System**: Using darkness to hide from perceived surveillance
   - **Distraction Tools**: Hacking nearby devices to create diversions
   - **Sound Detection**: Careful movement to avoid triggering alerts

2. **Hacking Gameplay**:
   - **AR Interface**: Alex perceives an augmented reality overlay showing hackable networks
   - **Network Puzzles**: Mini-games representing breaching security systems
   - **Perception Shifts**: What appears as high-tech hacking to Alex is visualized to the player as mundane actions
   
3. **Environmental Traversal**:
   - **Parkour System**: Climbing, sliding, and vaulting to navigate urban environments
   - **Hidden Paths**: Discovering routes through ventilation, maintenance areas, and rooftops
   - **Reality Anchors**: Environmental cues that temporarily ground Alex in reality

4. **Combat Elements**:
   - **Non-lethal Takedowns**: Subduing perceived agents
   - **Improvised Tech Weapons**: Devices Alex believes can disrupt surveillance
   - **Reality Shifting**: Enemies that phase between appearing threatening and appearing as ordinary civilians

5. **Level Design**:
   - Urban environments that transform between normal city streets and perceived high-security zones
   - Safe houses where Alex can regroup and plan
   - Progressive difficulty as surveillance appears to become more sophisticated

### Episode 2: "Quantum Consciousness"

#### Expanded Gameplay Elements
1. **Reality Manipulation**:
   - **Gravity Control**: Areas where Alex believes they can alter gravitational forces
   - **Matter Phasing**: Walking through certain barriers Alex perceives as quantum-permeable
   - **Probability Fields**: Creating zones where physics behaves differently
   - **Time Dilation**: Slowing or speeding up perceived time in limited areas

2. **Scientific "Experiments"**:
   - **Physics Puzzles**: Using perceived quantum abilities to solve environmental challenges
   - **Reality Testing**: Sections requiring experimentation with different powers
   - **Data Collection**: Gathering evidence that confirms Alex's theories

3. **Enhanced Movement**:
   - **Quantum Leap**: Short-range teleportation between platforms
   - **Wave Function**: Temporarily existing in multiple positions simultaneously
   - **Dimensional Shift**: Moving through alternative paths visible only to Alex

4. **Combat Systems**:
   - **Energy Projection**: Ranged attacks using "quantum energy"
   - **Probability Shield**: Defensive ability that "alters the probability of being hit"
   - **Reality Bubble**: Creating zones where enemies are affected by altered physics

5. **Level Design**:
   - Research facilities that transform between ordinary and futuristic
   - Abstract quantum realms during deep delusion states
   - Progressive power fluctuations as treatment affects Alex's delusions

### Episode 3: "Nanomachine Invasion"

#### Expanded Gameplay Elements
1. **Infection Visualization**:
   - **Corruption Overlay**: Visual effect showing perceived nanomachine spread
   - **Scanner Vision**: Ability to "detect" infection in environments and NPCs
   - **Contamination Zones**: Areas Alex perceives as heavily infected

2. **Debugging Mechanics**:
   - **Purification Tools**: Devices Alex believes can remove nanomachines
   - **Code Injection**: Mini-games representing debugging infected systems
   - **Firewall Creation**: Establishing safe zones within infected areas
   
3. **Body Adaptation**:
   - **Nanomachine Integration**: Abilities Alex believes come from controlled nanomachines
   - **System Upgrades**: Collecting components to enhance perceived abilities
   - **Metamorphosis**: Limited transformation abilities during intense delusions

4. **Combat System**:
   - **Anti-Nano Weapons**: Specialized tools for fighting perceived nanomachine entities
   - **Swarm Behavior**: Enemy AI that simulates nanomachine collective intelligence
   - **Infection Mechanics**: Managing Alex's own perceived infection levels

5. **Level Design**:
   - Environments that transform between normal and bio-digital horror
   - Body-horror elements that reshape the environment
   - Progressive infection spread creating urgency

### Episode 4: "The Algorithm"

#### Expanded Gameplay Elements
1. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - **Connection System**: Linking environmental elements using a detective-style interface
   - **Data Visualization**: Alex perceives patterns in ordinary objects
   - **Augmented Reality**: Overlay showing hidden connections between elements

2. **Information Gathering**:
   - **Evidence Collection**: Documenting connections in a digital notebook
   - **Conversation System**: Extracting information from NPCs who may be "part of the pattern"
   - **Decryption Tools**: Uncovering hidden messages in ordinary text

3. **Reality Reconstruction**:
   - **Memory Palaces**: Building conceptual spaces to organize information
   - **Pattern Manipulation**: Rearranging elements to reveal new connections
   - **Truth Anchors**: Distinguishing actual evidence from pattern pareidolia

4. **Combat Elements**:
   - **Predictive Strikes**: Combat system based on "predicting" enemy patterns
   - **Exploiting Algorithms**: Finding weaknesses in perceived enemy behavior patterns
   - **Reality Disruption**: Abilities that break perceived programmed behaviors

5. **Level Design**:
   - Environments filled with potential pattern elements
   - Information hubs where connections can be processed
   - Progressive complexity as the perceived conspiracy deepens

### Progression Systems

1. **Coping Mechanisms**:
   - Unlockable techniques learned through therapy that help manage delusions
   - Can be upgraded through consistent use and therapy sessions

2. **Reality Anchoring**:
   - Collectible items that help ground Alex during episodes
   - Creating safe spaces where delusions are temporarily weakened

3. **Medication Management**:
   - System that affects delusion intensity and frequency
   - Balances side effects against symptom management

4. **Support Network**:
   - Relationships with NPCs that can be developed to provide different types of assistance
   - Some NPCs can accompany Alex during episodes, providing reality checks

### Transition Between Reality and Delusion

1. **Visual Transformation**:
   - Environments morphing between actual appearance and Alex's perception
   - Color palettes shifting to indicate mental state

2. **NPC Behavior Changes**:
   - Same characters appearing differently in delusional states
   - Dialog and behavior adjusting based on Alex's perception

3. **Gameplay Mechanic Shifts**:
   - Abilities that work in delusional states failing in reality
   - Physical laws changing as perception shifts

4. **Adaptive Difficulty**:
   - Challenge scaling based on Alex's current mental state
   - Reality sections focusing more on social challenges and daily life

This expanded gameplay framework maintains the integrity of the mental health narrative while creating engaging 3rd-person action-adventure mechanics that serve the story of Alex's journey.
