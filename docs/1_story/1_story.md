## Introduction

### Concept Overview
"Quantum State" is an action-adventure game centered on protagonist Alex, who struggles with hallucinations. Players experience the world through Alex's perspective, where reality and delusion blend together. The gameplay shifts between what Alex perceives and what's actually happening, creating unique gameplay mechanics based on these shifts in perception.

### Protagonist Background
Alex was once a brilliant software engineer whose life began to unravel after a traumatic incident at a tech company. With a deep passion for science and technology, Alex previously worked on cutting-edge AI systems and quantum computing projects. Now living alone in an apartment filled with computers, scientific journals, and abandoned coding projects, Alex experiences increasingly complex delusions while trying to maintain connections with former colleagues and find treatment.

Alex's journey is one of both external adventure through delusional scenarios and internal struggle toward understanding and managing the condition through a scientific lens.

### Narrative Structure
The game is structured around Alex's daily life, punctuated by episodes where delusions take hold. Each episode serves as a level or mission with distinct themes based on different types of delusional experiences:

1. **Reality Base** - Alex's apartment, neighborhood, and therapy sessions serve as "reality anchors"
2. **Delusional Episodes** - Action-adventure sequences that manifest Alex's delusions
3. **Lucid Moments** - Brief periods of clarity where Alex can distinguish reality from delusion

### Key Delusional Episodes

#### Episode 1: "Digital Surveillance"
**Delusion Type:** Paranoid surveillance delusion

**Gameplay:** Alex becomes convinced that an advanced AI system they helped develop is now monitoring every digital and physical move. The player must navigate both the real world and digital environments while avoiding "surveillance algorithms" and "compromised devices" that only Alex can identify. Stealth mechanics, hacking puzzles, and code-based solutions dominate this episode.

#### Episode 2: "Quantum Consciousness"
**Delusion Type:** Grandiose delusion

**Gameplay:** Alex believes they've discovered how to manipulate quantum reality through specialized code and mental patterns. Players gain temporary powers that feel real to Alex (reality manipulation, probability alteration) and must complete scientific "experiments" to prove their theory, only to eventually face the reality that these abilities were never real.

#### Episode 3: "Nanomachine Invasion" 
**Delusion Type:** Somatic delusion with paranoia

**Gameplay:** Alex becomes convinced that experimental nanomachines have infected both their body and the bodies of others. The world transforms into a technological body-horror landscape where Alex must "debug" themselves and others. This manifests as action sequences against nanobots and system corruptions only Alex can see.

#### Episode 4: "The Algorithm"
**Delusion Type:** Referential delusion

**Gameplay:** Random data points, computer code, scientific articles, and conversations appear interconnected in a vast technological conspiracy. Players solve complex programming puzzles by connecting seemingly unrelated elements that, to Alex, form a coherent pattern revealing a hidden technological truth.

### Reality vs. Delusion Mechanics

The game employs several mechanics to represent the blurring of reality and delusion:

1. **Digital Distortion** - Computer screens, devices, and eventually environments warp and transform as delusions intensify
2. **NPC Reactions** - Other characters respond with concern or confusion to Alex's actions during delusional states
3. **Reality Checks** - Scientific instruments, logic puzzles, or interactions that temporarily ground Alex in reality
4. **Medication Mechanics** - Managing medication affects the frequency and intensity of delusional episodes
5. **Sensory Overload** - Heightened sound, color, and digital glitches during episodes

### Character Growth & Treatment

Throughout the game, Alex can:
1. Attend therapy sessions that provide insight into the condition
2. Build a support network of understanding NPCs
3. Learn coping mechanisms that become gameplay tools
4. Gradually distinguish between real threats and delusional ones

### Endings

Multiple endings reflect Alex's journey:
1. **Management** - Alex learns to live with the condition through proper treatment
2. **Acceptance** - Alex builds a supportive community while continuing to experience episodes
3. **Relapse** - Alex rejects help and becomes fully immersed in delusions
4. **Recovery** - Alex achieves significant improvement through consistent treatment

### Notes on Representation

This game aims to:
- Portray mental illness with compassion and accuracy
- Avoid stigmatizing stereotypes about delusional disorders
- Distinguish between having delusions and being "crazy" or violent
- Show that treatment and support can lead to management of symptoms
- Create engaging gameplay that helps players empathize with those experiencing mental health challenges
